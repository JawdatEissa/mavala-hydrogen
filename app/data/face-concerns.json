    "concern": "Your skin follows a very precise biorhythm: it defends itself during daylight, and renews itself at night. Lack of sun exposure or sleep, stress, pollution, or smoking can disrupt the proper functioning of the skin biorhythm and desynchronise its internal clock.

Its botanical extracts refresh, smoothe and soothe skin, while maintaining a good moisture balance. Caress Toning Lotion gently completes cleansing of the skin. Its plant extracts have astringent, refreshing, smoothing and lightly purifying properties, while helping keep a perfect moisture level. Without alcohol.\n\nTo respond to the principal need of your skin: apply ANTI-AGE PRO Day Serum every day in the morning to maximise physiological cutaneous daily activities. Its chronopeptides mimic the benefits of daylight on the skin in order to preserve its own protective potential. It's also rich in antioxidants and anti-ageing Alpine Rose stem cells. Follow with a daily application of ANTI-AGE PRO Day Cream, rejuvenating and antioxidant skincare which creates a protective bubble on the surface of your skin lasting until the evening.\n\nAs a night complement, AQUA PLUS Multi-Moisturizing Sleeping Mask is the ideal product. A truly nocturnal moisturizing infusion, it helps the skin restore its water reserves and reinforce the protecting cutaneous barrier.\n\nTo hydrate and replenish your complexion from the first signs of fatigue, spray SKIN VITALITY Alpine Micro-Mist on your face.
