    "concern": "Nail fungus (onychomycosis) is a common fungal infection that affects the nail plate, causing discoloration, thickening, and brittleness. The nail may turn yellow, brown, or white, and can become crumbly or distorted over time. Fungal infections thrive in warm, moist environments and can spread from one nail to another. They are often contracted in public places like swimming pools, gyms, or through shared footwear. If left untreated, the infection can worsen and become painful.",
    "solution": "MAVA-MED is a powerful antifungal nail solution specifically formulated to tackle fungal nail infections effectively. Its unique \"Instant Killer\" complex stops fungi from spreading and aids in nail healing. Enriched with lavender and eucalyptus essential oils, lactic acid and urea, it creates an environment that deters fungal growth while nourishing the nail plate. Apply MAVA-MED twice daily to the affected nails after cleaning and drying them thoroughly. Continue treatment for several weeks until the infection clears and healthy nail growth is visible. For severe or persistent infections, we recommend consulting a dermatologist for a complete diagnosis.",
